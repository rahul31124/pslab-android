## Development Environment Setup

### Project Overview

This is a **Flutter cross-platform application** that supports:
- **Android** (primary platform)
- **iOS** 
- **Linux** (with USB device support)
- **macOS**
- **Windows**
- **Web**

The app interfaces with PSLab hardware devices via USB and provides scientific instrument functionality.

### Required Software 

**Flutter & Dart**
- Flutter (stable channel)
- Dart (bundled with Flutter)

**Java**
- Java (LTS version required for Android builds)


### Flutter SDK Setup

#### Install Flutter
##### macOS (via Homebrew)
```bash
brew install --cask flutter
```

##### Linux

Follow the official Flutter setup guide for Linux: <https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/linux/setup>
#### Windows

Follow the official Flutter setup guide for Windows: <https://docs.flutter.dev/platform-integration/windows/setup>

### Flutter development setup (VS Code)

The instructions below explain how to install the Flutter SDK, set up Visual Studio Code with the Flutter and Dart extensions, and run the project using `flutter run`. These steps avoid Android Studio-specific instructions and focus on a minimal, cross-platform Flutter workflow.

Prerequisites
- A supported operating system (Windows, macOS, or Linux).
- A working internet connection to download the Flutter SDK and extensions.

1) Install the Flutter SDK
- Download the Flutter SDK from https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install and follow the platform-specific instructions. On Windows, extract the SDK (for example to `C:\src\flutter`) and add the `bin` folder to your PATH environment variable. On macOS/Linux, follow the steps on the Flutter website for adding `flutter` to your PATH.
- After installation, open a terminal (PowerShell on Windows) and run:

```powershell
flutter --version
flutter doctor
```

Resolve any missing components suggested by `flutter doctor`. If you plan to build desktop apps, follow the platform-specific toolchain steps suggested by `flutter doctor` (e.g., install Visual Studio on Windows for Windows desktop builds).

2) Set up Visual Studio Code
- Install VS Code (if you don't have it) and open the project folder in VS Code.
- Install the following extensions from the Extensions view:
  - Flutter (includes the Dart extension)
  - Dart (if the Flutter extension did not install it automatically)
- (Optional) If VS Code cannot find the Flutter SDK, set the `dart.flutterSdkPath` setting to the SDK location in your VS Code settings.

3) Prepare the project and run
- In the project root, fetch packages and generate any code:

```powershell
flutter pub get
flutter pub run build_runner build --delete-conflicting-outputs  # if the project uses code generation
```

- Run the app on the default device (emulator, connected device, or desktop target):

```powershell
flutter run
```

If you want to run on a specific device, list available devices and pass `-d`:

```powershell
flutter devices
flutter run -d windows   # example: run on Windows desktop
```

Notes and troubleshooting
- If you see issues related to missing SDKs or tools, run `flutter doctor` and follow the recommended fixes.
- Building Android APKs or running on Android devices may require Android SDK tools. If you need Android targets later, install the Android SDK separately; Android Studio is not required for Flutter development but can simplify SDK installation.
- For fast iteration in VS Code, use the Debug panel (press F5) or the Flutter toolbar (Run and Debug).


### Application Flavors

### Troubleshooting

**Common Issues:**

1. **USB permissions on Linux:**
   - Ensure udev rules are installed: `ls -la /etc/udev/rules.d/99-pslab.rules`
   - Check user is in dialout group: `groups $USER`

2. **Flutter version mismatch:**
   ```bash
   flutter channel stable
   flutter upgrade
   flutter pub get
   ```

3. **iOS build issues:**
   ```bash
   cd ios
   pod deintegrate
   pod install
   cd ..
   flutter clean
   flutter pub get
   ```

4. **Android build issues:**
   - Ensure an LTS Java version is installed: java -version 
   - Clean build: `flutter clean && flutter pub get`

5. **Git dependency issues:**
   ```bash
   flutter pub deps
   flutter pub get
   ```

### Verify Setup

Follow the steps below to confirm that your local development environment is correctly configured.

#### 1. Check Flutter installation
```bash
flutter doctor
 ```
Resolve any critical issues reported by the command.

#### 2. Install dependencies and run tests
```bash
flutter pub get
flutter test
 ```

#### 3. Run the application
```bash
flutter run
 ```
Run the app on a connected physical device, emulator, or desktop target.

#### 4. (Optional) Using Android Studio
If you prefer Android Studio:
- Open the project directory in Android Studio.
- Wait for the Gradle sync to complete.
- Check the Build and Run windows for errors.

Note: If you encounter a Gradle sync error such as
“failed to find …”, use the suggested action (for example, Install missing platform(s) and sync project) to allow Android Studio to download the required components.

Once the app builds successfully and launches on your target device or emulator, the setup is complete.

The currently supported Flutter, Dart, and platform versions are defined in the project configuration files (for example `pubspec.yaml`, Android Gradle files, and iOS project settings).

### Permission manifests

Permissions are declared in the platform manifests:
- Android: android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml
- iOS: ios/Runner/Info.plist

The app may request permissions at runtime depending on the instrument/features being used (e.g., location, microphone, storage, USB). 

## Setup to use PSLab with Android App
To use PSLab device with Android, you simply need an OTG cable, an Android Device with USB Host feature enabled ( most modern phones have OTG support ) and PSLab Android App. Connect PSLab device to Android Phone via OTG cable. Rest is handled by App itself.

## Translations

We use [Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/fossasia/pslab-app/) for managing translations.

If you want to help translate the app into your language, please visit the [PSLab App project on Weblate](https://hosted.weblate.org/projects/fossasia/pslab-app/).

### Technical Details
The app uses the standard Flutter `flutter_localizations` package.
* **Location:** Translation files are stored in `lib/l10n/` in `.arb` (Application Resource Bundle) format.
* **Template:** The source of truth is `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`.
* **Contribution:** While we prefer translations submitted via Weblate to avoid merge conflicts, you can also manually edit the `.arb` files and submit a Pull Request.


## Contributions Best Practices

### Code practices

Please help us follow the best practice to make it easy for the reviewer as well as the contributor. We want to focus on the code quality more than on managing pull request ethics.

  * Single commit per pull request.
  * Reference the issue numbers in the commit message. Follow the pattern ``` Fixes #<issue number> <commit message>```
  * Follow uniform design practices. The design language must be consistent throughout the app.
  * The pull request will not get merged until and unless the commits are squashed. In case there are multiple commits on the PR, the commit author needs to squash them and not the maintainers cherrypicking and merging squashes.
  * If the PR is related to any front end change, please attach relevant screenshots in the pull request description.

#### How to `git squash`?

As a tip for new developers those who struggle with squashing commits into one, multiple commits may appear in your pull request mostly due to following reasons.

 * Intentionally adding multiple commit messages after each change without just `git add`ing.
 * Updating the current branch with the remote so a merge commit takes place.

Despite any reason, follow the steps given below to squash all commits into one adhering to our best practices.

  * Setup remote to upstream branch if not set before

`$ git remote add upstream https://github.com/fossasia/pslab-app.git`

  * Check into the branch related to the pull request

`$ git checkout <branch-name>`

  * Perform a soft reset to retain the changes while removing all the commit details

`$ git reset --soft upstream/development`

  * Add files to the staging area

`$ git add <file paths or "." to add everything>`

  * Create a new commit with a proper message following commit message guidelines

`$ git commit -m "tag: commit message"`

  * If you have already made a pull request

`$ git push -f origin <branch-name>`

//////////


### Branch Policy

We have the following branches
* **development** All development goes on in this branch. If you're making a contribution, you are supposed to make a pull request to _development_. Make sure it passes a build check on Travis.
* **master** This contains the stable code. After significant features/bugfixes are accumulated on development, we move it to master.
* **apk** This branch contains automatically generated apk file for testing.

### Code style

Please try to follow the mentioned guidelines while writing and submitting your code as it makes easier for the reviewer and other developers to understand.

 * While naming the layout files, ensure that the convention followed is (activity/fragment) _ (name).xml like ```activity_oscilloscope.xml``` , ```fragment_control_main.xml``` .
 * Name the views and widgets defined in the layout files as (viewtype/widget) _ (fragment/activity name) _ (no. in the file) like ```spinner_channel_select_la1``` , ```button_activity_oscilloscope1``` .
 * The activity/fragment file name corresponding to the layout files should be named as                       (activity/fragment name)(activity/fragment).java like ```ChannelsParameterFragment.java``` corresponding to the layout file ```fragment_channels_parameter.xml``` .
 * The corresponding widgets for buttons, textboxes, checkboxes etc. in activity files should be named as (viewtype/widget)(fragment/activity name)(no. in the file) like ```spinnerChannelSelect1``` corresponding to ```spinner_channel_select1``` .
